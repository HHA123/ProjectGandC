Here follows a short description of each variable:

This Variable was contain an index number for each subject 1-30
"subject"

This variable describes six different activitis carried out by subjects
"activity"

These signals were used to estimate the mean of the variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
